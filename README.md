# Cargo Contract Usage : 
You can always use `cargo contract help` to print information on available
commands and their usage.

##### `cargo contract build`

Compiles the contract into optimized WebAssembly bytecode, generates metadata for it,
and bundles both together in a `<name>.contract` file, which you can use for
deploying the contract on-chain.

##### `cargo contract check`

Checks that the code builds as WebAssembly. This command does not output any `<name>.contract`
artifact to the `target/` directory.

##### 'cargo test'

Runs the unit test cases for the specified contract.
